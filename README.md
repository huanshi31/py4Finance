# usage: conda [-h] [-V] command ...
# 
# conda is a tool for managing and deploying applications, environments and packages.
# 
# Options:
# 
# positional arguments:
#   command
#     info         Display information about current conda install.
#     help         Displays a list of available conda commands and their help
#                  strings.
#     list         List linked packages in a conda environment.
#     search       Search for packages and display their information. The input
#                  is a Python regular expression. To perform a search with a
#                  search string that starts with a -, separate the search from
#                  the options with --, like 'conda search -- -h'. A * in the
#                  results means that package is installed in the current
#                  environment. A . means that package is not installed but is
#                  cached in the pkgs directory.
#     create       Create a new conda environment from a list of specified
#                  packages.
#     install      Installs a list of packages into a specified conda
#                  environment.
#     update       Updates conda packages to the latest compatible version. This
#                  command accepts a list of package names and updates them to
#                  the latest versions that are compatible with all other
#                  packages in the environment. Conda attempts to install the
#                  newest versions of the requested packages. To accomplish
#                  this, it may update some packages that are already installed,
#                  or install additional packages. To prevent existing packages
#                  from updating, use the --no-update-deps option. This may
#                  force conda to install older versions of the requested
#                  packages, and it does not prevent additional dependency
#                  packages from being installed. If you wish to skip dependency
#                  checking altogether, use the '--force' option. This may
#                  result in an environment with incompatible packages, so this
#                  option must be used with great caution.
#     upgrade      Alias for conda update. See conda update --help.
#     remove       Remove a list of packages from a specified conda environment.
#     uninstall    Alias for conda remove. See conda remove --help.
#     config       Modify configuration values in .condarc. This is modeled
#                  after the git config command. Writes to the user .condarc
#                  file (/Users/huanshi/.condarc) by default.
#     clean        Remove unused packages and caches.
#     package      Low-level conda package utility. (EXPERIMENTAL)
# 
# optional arguments:
#   -h, --help     Show this help message and exit.
#   -V, --version  Show the conda version number and exit.
# 
# other commands, such as "conda build", are available when additional conda
# packages (e.g. conda-build) are installed
